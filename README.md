# Flight Reservation Application
You are tasked with implementing a fight booking and monitoring application from scratch. You will use all tools at your disposal to create a Single Page Application front end that will be supported by a Spring based application hosting REST endpoints. You will be required to handle user profiles, track live updating flight data, provide the capacity to book flights, verify correct information, provide the user with informative messages in the case of an error, visualize the flight paths of various flights, create a pathing algorithm to allow users to book collections of viable flights with viable layovers in order to reach their destination in the shortest time possible, and allow a user to review their flight history.

### Starting the Project
In order to start the project, you must
1. In Eclipse, run `com.cooksys.FlightApplication.java` as a Spring Boot Project
2. In the command prompt, navigate to the `ui` directory inside the project
3. Run `npm install --save`
4. Run `npm build`
5. Run `npm start`
6. In the browser, navigate to `localhost:8080`

If the project has started successfully, you should see a page with a map on it. This map should have four cities in Tennessee connected by lines of different colors.
